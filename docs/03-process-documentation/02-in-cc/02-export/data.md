# Process data

## Inputs
### CGM

### CRAC

## Hardcoded data

### RaoParameters

The computations are based on parameters, described in the [OpenRAO documentation](https://powsybl.readthedocs.io/projects/openrao/en/latest/parameters.html).

The values of the parameters for the Italy North export process are defined in the [gridcapa-deployment configuration](https://github.com/farao-community/gridcapa-deployment/blob/master/configuration/cse-export-runner-itools-config.yml).
Compared to this list, a few parameters might be modified during the computation, directly in the code.
Others, if not defined, are set to the default values listed in the documentation.
